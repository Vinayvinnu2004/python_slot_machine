# python_slot_machine
This project is a console based Slot Machine game built using Python. The player starts with a balance, places a bet, and spins three reels that animate continuously for a fixed duration. Wins and losses are decided by matching symbols, with sound effects and balance updates providing a realistic terminal based gaming experience.
